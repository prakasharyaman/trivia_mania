{"Implementation approach": "We will develop 'trivia_mania' using JavaScript to ensure it runs in any modern web browser. For real-time communication and multiplayer support, we'll use the Socket.IO library. The game's frontend will be built with React to create a responsive and dynamic user interface. For the backend, Node.js with Express will handle HTTP requests and game logic. We'll use MongoDB for storing questions and game data, managed by Mongoose for schema validation. The system will be designed with RESTful API principles for clear interface definitions between frontend and backend.", "File list": ["app.js", "server.js", "client/", "client/components/", "client/components/Game.jsx", "client/components/Leaderboard.jsx", "client/components/Question.jsx", "server/models/", "server/models/Question.js", "server/models/GameSession.js", "server/routes/", "server/routes/gameRoutes.js", "server/controllers/", "server/controllers/gameController.js", "server/socketHandlers/", "server/socketHandlers/gameSocket.js"], "Data structures and interfaces": "classDiagram\n    class App {\n        +Express app\n        +SocketIO io\n        +initialize() void\n    }\n    class Server {\n        +httpServer server\n        +start() void\n    }\n    class Client {\n        +React component\n        +render() void\n    }\n    class Game {\n        +String id\n        +Array players\n        +Map leaderboard\n        +initGame() void\n        +updateLeaderboard() void\n    }\n    class Question {\n        +String text\n        +Array choices\n        +String answer\n        +getQuestion(difficulty: String) Question\n    }\n    class GameSession {\n        +String sessionID\n        +Array playerScores\n        +getCurrentLeaderboard() Map\n    }\n    class GameController {\n        +startNewGame() String\n        +getQuestion() Question\n        +updateScore(playerID: String, score: Number) void\n    }\n    App --> Server\n    Server --> Client\n    Client --> Game\n    Game --> Question\n    Game --> GameSession\n    GameController --> GameSession", "Program call flow": "sequenceDiagram\n    participant C as Client\n    participant A as App\n    participant S as Server\n    participant GC as GameController\n    participant G as Game\n    participant Q as Question\n    participant GS as GameSession\n    C->>A: Initialize App\n    A->>S: Start Server\n    S->>C: Serve Client\n    C->>GC: startNewGame()\n    GC->>G: initGame()\n    G->>Q: getQuestion(difficulty)\n    Q-->>G: return Question\n    G->>GS: create GameSession\n    GS-->>G: return sessionID\n    C->>GC: updateScore(playerID, score)\n    GC->>GS: updateScore(playerID, score)\n    GS-->>GC: return updated leaderboard\n    GC-->>C: return updated leaderboard", "Anything UNCLEAR": "It's not specified how the question content will be created and updated.
