## Implementation approach

We will develop 'trivia_mania' using JavaScript to ensure it runs in any modern web browser. For real-time communication and multiplayer support, we'll use the Socket.IO library. The game's frontend will be built with React to create a responsive and dynamic user interface. For the backend, Node.js with Express will handle HTTP requests and game logic. We'll use MongoDB for storing questions and game data, managed by Mongoose for schema validation. The system will be designed with RESTful API principles for clear interface definitions between frontend and backend.

## Anything UNCLEAR

It's not specified how the question content will be created and updated. We will assume a predefined question pool stored in MongoDB, which can be updated by an admin interface. Further clarification is needed on whether user-generated content will be supported.
